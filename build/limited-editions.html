            <h3>Make Your Writing Collectible</h3>
            <p>Booksie is excited to announce Booksie LimIted Editions (BLEs)< a new way for authors to promote their writing and for readers to collect the digital work of emerging authors.</p>
                <p> <a class="btn btn-primary" href="#"> <i class="icon icon-link me-1"></i> Access Booksie Limited Editions</a></p>
                <h3>Benefits for Authors:</h3>
                <p>Connect more deeply with fans and attract new ones by creating a collectible digital version of your book, short story, article, or more.</p>
                <p>Attract attention to your writing by having BLEs as another item to promote across social and your website.</p>
                <p>Create graphic rich content that is distributed as a PDF.</p>
                <p>Gain additional exposure as Booksie features BLEs across its website and social channels.</p>

                <h3>Trends in Braided Wig Length</h3>
                <p>Length is a key factor in choosing the right braided wig, as it significantly impacts the overall style and appearance. The current trend in braided wig length is leaning towards the extremes—either very long or very short. Long braided wigs, often extending to the waist or beyond, are popular for their dramatic effect. These wigs create a striking look and offer the flexibility to style the braids in various ways, such as high ponytails, buns, or elaborate updos.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, short braided wigs are gaining traction among those who prefer a more manageable and casual look. These wigs usually fall just above the shoulders and are ideal for everyday wear. Short braided wigs are easy to maintain and offer a chic, modern appearance without the weight and length of longer wigs.</p>
                <p>Medium-length braided wigs remain a classic choice for those who want a balanced look. These wigs offer the best of both worlds—long enough to style in different ways but short enough to be practical for daily wear. Medium-length wigs are particularly popular for those new to wearing braided wigs, as they offer versatility without being overwhelming.</p>
                <h3>Benefits for Readers/Collectors</h3>
                <p>Collect and own a copy of the writing of emerging authors before they are better recognized.</p>
                <p>Support the work of authors you like and help them towards their goals.</p>
                <p>Own a copy of their writing which you can sell to others, transfer, and bequeath to your heirs.</p>
                <p>Dip your toe into blockchain collecting.</p>

            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <h4>Q. What do you mean we can own a Limited Edition? Don't I own books I purchase on Amazon or other sites?</h4>
            <p>A. You do not own the books you purchase on the Amazon site. You cannot transfer the book off Amazon to another platform and you cannot sell or bequeath them to anyone else. You are "borrowing" the book from Amazon. If you close your account, or Amazon closes your account, the book is gone. With Booksie Limited Editions, the content you buy is recorded on a third party Blockchain. Booksie does not control this ownership. Anyone fan verify ownership and you can use the Blockchain to transfer the work to someone.</p>
            <h4>Q. How can I make money using Limited Editions?</h4>
            <p>A. You can choose to release your content as a Limited Edition and promote it to your fans and followers. They then have an opportunity to purchase this special version of your work, a version they can own. For every work you sell, you keep 100% of the proceeds after transaction fees are taken out.</p>
            <h3>Q. How should I price my Limited Edition?</h3>
            <p>A. Booksie recommends pricing your Limited Edition higher than what you would sell the content for on another site. That's because these are limited in quantity. Think about how limited edition prints, clothing, cars, sell for higher than the regular edition. We would recommend at least doubling the regular price.</p>
            <h4>Q. Why do I have to be a Booksie Premium member to create a Limited Edition?</h4>
            <p>A. Limited Editions is a premium feature of the site. It costs Booksie money to maintain the system and review the content that is published. Booksie operates as a platform to help writers monetize their work and includes Limited Edition in the premium fee instead of charging a royalty.</p>
            <h4>Q. Does Booksie charge a transaction fee and how is this different from a royalty?</h4>
            <p>A. Yes, Booksie and its partner Chainletter Labs charges a 20% transaction fee to cover the cost of the credit card transactions and Blockchain minting fees. Anything beyond these fees are 100% provided to the author or publisher. A royalty is an agreement to split the net proceeds of a sale after transaction fees. We do not charge a royalty.</p>
            <h4>Q. Can I delete my work at any time?</h4>
            <p>A. Yes, you can delete your work from Limited Editions but anything sold will remain out there. Because the purchaser retains ownership of the content, there is no way to delete it or claw it back.</p>
            <h4>Q. Is it easy to publish a Limited Edition?</h4>
            <p>A. Yes, it's no more difficult than publishing a piece of content on Booksie. We've made it easy for anyone to be able to quickly and easily create and distribute Limited Editions. The video tutorial below shows you how to do it.</p>
            <h4>Q. What formats are accepted as Limited Editions?</h4>
            <p>A. Right now, only PDF documents are accepted as BLEs. As a Premium member, you can generate a PDF copy of any content posted on Booksie via the More section in your Portfolio. Microsoft Word and Google Docs also have tools to allow you to export your document as a PDF.</p>
            <h4>Q. Can I include illustrations and graphics in my Limited Edition?</h4>
            <p>A. Yes, absolutely. Make your BLE as illustrative and graphically heavy as you like.</p>
            <h4>Q. Do I retain the right to my work if I publish a Limited Edition?</h4>
            <p>A. Yes, publishing a Limited Edition does not impact the copyright on the work. If you are a publisher, Limited Editions do not change the copyright status of the content.</p>
            <h4>Q. If I'm a publisher, can I publish a Limited Edition?</h4>
            <p>A. Yes, although our partner Chainletter Labs has a variety of solution for publishers. Reach out to them to learn more.</p>
            <h4>Q. Are all genres accepted as Limited Editions?</h4>
            <p>A. If the work can appear on Booksie, you can publish it as a Limited Edition. You must own the copyright or have permission from the copyright holder and the content must adhere to the Booksie Content standards.</p>
            <h4>Q. How do I know how many Limited Editions I've sold?</h4>
            <p>A. Booksie keeps track of this in your Limited Editions account settings tab. You can see your sales activity and how much you've made. In addition, you can also see this on the WAX Blockchain since every transaction is recorded there. This is why you don't need to trust us to know your sales.</p>

            <p>I would like to join in next. If chosen, I would like to suggest _your_ short story (lol) &quot;The Secret Lives of Strangers&quot; for inspiration (https://www.booksie.com/467912-the-secret-lives-of-strangers)</p>
            <p>I&apos;d like to write my entry as part of that story&apos;s miniverse. I realize this may be slightly outside the above &quot;prompting&quot; rules, but please accommodate as possible. As per my comment in your story&apos;s page, you already know I had intended to do a follow up piece on Secret Lives. I had a different idea for the style I’d employ. I am more into what I call &quot;structure-less rambling&quot; which is a style inspired on James Joyce&apos;s and Julio Cortazar&apos;s &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; literary styles (tho significantly less polished than theirs, lol). Anyway, regardless of style, this is a good opportunity to deliver on my intent to write on your enticing miniverse.</p>
            <p>There is, of course, a wrinkle: Your rules say (if chosen) the next contest entry must follow my style. However, I have not published anything on Booksie, yet. Let&apos;s do this: if I&apos;m chosen, the next entry should impersonate James Joyce&apos;s writing style in the short story &quot;Eveline&quot; (published in his &quot;Dubliners&quot; collection of shorts and easily accessible from your local library or $0.99 on Kindle). In spite of that big name, the style isn&apos;t intimidating at all. Quite the opposite, it&apos;s refreshingly simple and filled with one-liners and first person narrative.</p>
            <p>An alternative would be for me to pick a booksie entry in my stead. But the booksie/style I&apos;d pick in that case is a difficult style to follow. She&apos;s a brave writer, unafraid to take her story to depths I suspect not too many would follow and that courage is very much part of her style, IMO. Lastly, I should add that circumventing rules isn’t my thing (as chaos could ensue if each person picks which rules to ignore), but I see this as the best way for me to participate and keep the contest going. Let me know what you decide.</p>

            <p>Let&apos;s do it - pleased to have you kick off the challenge! A few things:</p>
            <p>We can leave a choice up to the next participant, to either portray the writing style of said Booksie author (message me with a link to her profile please, and just be sure that she is aware of the challenge, too!) or James Joyce. I would prefer to keep this circulating within Booksie, as the purpose it to familiarize with one another and provide users an opportunity to read and get read - but no hard feelings if the next person interested chooses the latter as their challenge.</p>
            <p>Side note here, on how much I admire your consistent promotion of other authors, both beginners and seasoned! That is part of what makes a person a wonderful addition to any writing community! Support!</p>
            <p>Also, I am very honored you&apos;ve chosen one of my stories! Let&apos;s be honest here - I secretly wished I could have named myself as the first to be &quot;impersonated&quot; and kick off the challenge... but it seemed very vain and too suggestive. My ego is gleaming right now. Lol!</p>
            <p>Go ahead with your idea. Although it is strongly encouraged as part of the ITSOWC to imitate your &quot;theme-author&quot; as closely as possible, this is, after all, just a challenge and some rules are going to be bent in every entry! In contrast to those of a contest, the rules here are much less concrete. It&apos;d be interesting to see in which ways each participant decides to mirror their &quot;theme-author&quot; (I think I&apos;m making that the official term by use? Lol) and interpret their style. Perhaps it&apos;s not in the structure - as you said, you are more into &quot;structure-less rambling&quot; - but in the way that characters think, behave, connect, or are introduced, or the themes and so on.</p>
            <p>Excited to see what you come up with and how &quot;the Secret Lives of Strangers&quot; has inspired you! I&apos;m so eager to read your &quot;spin-off&quot;! Remember, there is no time limit here. Take all that you need. (This challenge will be a lengthy, but worthwhile, one all the way through I think!) :-)</p>

            <p>Rae, this sounds like an awesome idea, except that I&apos;m either too stupid or haven&apos;t had enough sleep (probably both!) to understand the rules :-/</p>
            <p>What do I say here? Do I choose an author I want to impersonate, or do I suggest myself as an author to be impersonated?</p>
